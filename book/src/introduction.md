# Introduction

Unreal Engine Build (`uebuild`) is a Command Line tool for interfacing with [Unreal Engine](docs.unrealengine.com) ([GitHub](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine)). It is written in Rust and provides methods for interfacing with a project such as; compiling from source, running the editor or standalone instance, cooking the project, and managing localization.

Unreal Engine Build is _not_ owned or maintained by Epic Games. This is a community creation and does not reflect or represent Epic Games or the official Unreal Engine project.

In this book you will find a guide for using the tool & what the specific commands are and how they are used or interface with a project. It is rendered using [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook), and much of it is based on the tennets and examples set forth therein, so huge thanks and credit to contributors to that amazing project.
