# Compilation

Subcommands for setting up and compiling a project from source.

- [`gen-project-files`](gen-project-files.md) generates the Visual Studio `.sln` file so the source code can be opened in an IDE.
- [`compile`](compile.md) compiles the project (and embedded engine/editor, if present) so it can be executed via the [`run commands`](../run).
