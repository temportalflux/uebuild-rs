# Run an Instance

Subcommands for running a standalone instance of the game or editor.

- [`editor`](editor.md): Opens the uproject in the unreal editor (using the precompiled or embedded editor).
- [`pisep`](pisep.md): Run a local play-in-editor instance of the project in a separate editor process. This is also known as a `Play In Separate Editor Process` (or `PISEP`).
